      <h3>ABOUT THE ISSUE</h3>
      <h4 class = "issue"> 
        Fast fashion refers to low-cost, swiftly manufactured clothing that mimics current runway and celebrity trends. It promotes rapid consumer turnover of garments, leading to substantial environmental pollution through overproduction. Additionally, fast fashion is criticized for exploiting workers and causing harm to animals as well. </h4>
     <h4 class = "solution"> Sustainable fashion focuses on reducing the environmental and social impact of clothing production and consumption. It promotes practices such as using eco-friendly materials, minimizing waste, and ensuring fair treatment of workers throughout the supply chain. Sustainable fashion aims to create clothing that is ethically produced, durable, and environmentally responsible. </h4>

    <p class = "fact1-text">   of Fast fashion produces more CO2 than aviation and shipping combined. It's the second-largest industrial polluter, responsible for around 10% of global pollutionâ€”more than the combined emissions from air travel and maritime transport!</p>
